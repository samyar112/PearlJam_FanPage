Project Overview

This project starts with a basic HTML structure, with plans to make it interactive by integrating CSS for styling and JavaScript for functionality. The goal is to display all Pearl Jam albums in a swipeable card interface, where users can like or dislike albums. 

Additionally, there will be an option to create a "like list" of songs, allowing users to easily add their favorite tracks to their collection.
